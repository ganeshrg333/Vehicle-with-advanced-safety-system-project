# Vehicle-with-advanced-safety-system-project
This is my Diploma final year project. Actually, this is a hardware project. Now days, In India people faced some problems about increase in the number of car accident, increase in the number of car thefts, drink and drive, etc. So to overcome on this problem we came with solution called “Vehicle with advanced safety system”. If we add this type of security in every vehicle it is very useful for everyone. We added some sensors in our project like Fingerprint sensor, Alcohol sensor, Gas sensor, Fire sensor, Etc. By using fingerprint sensor we protect the vehicle from thefts. By using fingerprint sensor we start the vehicle. If any person who drink alcohol &amp; travel from the vehicle we find that person by using alcohol sensor. With the help of gas leakage detector we detect the hazardous gas which is present in our car and harmful for our vehicle. Suppose unfortunately, there will be a vehicle accident is done in future, then with the help of GSM Module the message of vehicle accident is automatically send to that number which is saved by the microcontroller. Also we get exact location of vehicle by using GPS. On highway or on road there are some speed limits i.e. 80KM, 100KM, Etc. In this project we make a road and set some speed limits, like 80KM, 100KM, 120KM, Etc. If driver over speed the vehicle and break the speed limit then message of over speeding is sent to traffic police by using GSM Module. Then traffic police get exact location of car by using GPS. So, this concept will very useful in future.
